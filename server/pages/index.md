I am a data scientist who builds practical solutions on the intersections between technology and business. Currently wrapping up my Master's degree in Strategy & Organizational Design, while working as a data scientist at [CWire](https://cwire.com).

I love solving ambiguous problems, and I have experience from founding teams, hackathons and consultancy work, as well as volunteering.

Based in Otaniemi, Finland.
